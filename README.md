# Assignment 8

The microservice will show a list of agents from the text file named 'agentlist' then prompt the user to either randomly select an agent's name or show the list of agents. Whatever the user decides to do, the selection will be added to a text file named currentagent.txt.

If the user decide to randomly select a new agent, the 'currentagent' text file will be erased and updated with a new entry.

*****INSTRUCTIONS*****

INPUT 1 to randomly select an agent name

OR

INPUT 0 to view the list of agents

OR

INPUT 2 to exit the program

If user input is any number other than '2', the loop will restart.
