# Assignment 8

The microservice will show a list of agents from the text file named 'agentlist' then prompt the user to either input an agent's name or randomly select. Whatever the user decides to do, the selection will be added to a text file named currentagent.txt.

If the user decide to pick a new agent with either option, the 'currentagent' text file will be erased and updated with a new entry.

*****INSTRUCTIONS*****

INPUT 1 to manually type an agent name

OR

INPUT 0 to randomly select an agent from 'agentlist' to update 'currentagent'

OR

INPUT 2 to view the agent list

If any other input beside 0 and 1 is input, the microservice will end.
