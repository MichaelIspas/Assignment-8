# Assignment 8

The microservice will endlessly loop checking currentagent.txt file until it says '1' from my partner's main program then trigger a random selection process. The random selection process will check agentlist.txt and randomly select a line that is then converted to a string. The string will overwrite the currentagent.txt file to communicate to my partner's main program.
